## 📂 Tasks

### 🎬 Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
Build a model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.

---

### 💳 Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.

---

### 📉 Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
Predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical data and algorithms like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting.

---

### 📱 Task 4: Spam SMS Detection
Classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate using TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression.

---

### ✍️ Task 5: Handwritten Text Generation
Implement a character-level RNN to generate handwritten-like text. Train the model on handwriting datasets and generate new text sequences.
