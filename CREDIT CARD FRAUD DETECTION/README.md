# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is part of my **CodSoft Machine Learning Internship**.  
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world datasets.

## 📌 Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a major challenge in the financial industry.  
By analyzing transaction data, we can classify whether a transaction is **fraudulent** or **legitimate**.  
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to improve security and reduce financial losses.

## 🛠️ Techniques & Tools
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python 🐍, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests 🌲  
- **Methods**: Data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, evaluation with metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Exploration** 🔍 – Understand dataset structure and distribution.  
2. **Preprocessing** 🧹 – Handle missing values, scale features, balance classes (SMOTE).  
3. **Model Training** ⚙️ – Train multiple classifiers and tune hyperparameters.  
4. **Evaluation** 📈 – Compare models using confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report.  
5. **Prediction** 🎯 – Deploy model to predict fraud in new transactions.

## 📌 Results
- Achieved high recall to minimize false negatives (critical in fraud detection).  
- Random Forest performed best with balanced accuracy and precision.  
- Visualizations include ROC curve and confusion matrix for model comparison.
