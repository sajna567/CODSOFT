# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project is part of my **CodSoft Machine Learning Internship**.  
The objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) based on historical data.

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription‑based businesses.  
By analyzing customer behavior and demographics, we can identify patterns that indicate churn risk and take proactive measures to retain customers.

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Exploration** 🔍 – Inspect dataset, visualize churn distribution.  
2. **Preprocessing** 🧹 – Handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale numerical features.  
3. **Model Training** ⚙️ – Train multiple classifiers and tune hyperparameters.  
4. **Evaluation** 📈 – Compare models using confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report.  
5. **Prediction** 🎯 – Deploy model to predict churn for new customers.
